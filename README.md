## TODO

 * Validation option.


## Usage

This module exports one function:

### m3u8parse(input, nodeback)

`input` should be a String, Buffer or readable stream.
`nodeback` should be a function.
It will be called with arguments `(err, index)`.
`err` is an Error if one occurred, and some false-y value otherwise.
If there was no error, `index` will be the parsed data.

For details see [test/m3u8parse.test.js](test/m3u8parse.test.js).
